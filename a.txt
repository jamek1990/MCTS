If we want to prevent frauds – customers and employees must know that we are controlling and reacting.
One of our KPI show that we want to know about fraud events from alerts not from customer complaints.
We are implementing automatic monitoring with containing many anomaly detection algorithms.
On this slide we can see anomaly detection based on transactional connection of individual customers.
Nodes is accounts. Edges is transactions between them when higher then 1k PLN.
The largest graph component shows anomaly. 
For example:
•	Long chain transitions where customer uses special offers for opening new accounts
•	Using a individual account to conduct business activities.
2.
Fraud detection requires connecting many points (many sources of data). 
For example:
4 people have the same phone number – family; customer know each other; close relationship
4 people have the same phone number – a dishonest employee modified the number to perform unamortized transactions – fraud
So We don’t know… 
To minimize False/Positive alerts we must add more views, system logs, AML alerts, HR alerst ets.
We must connected dots.
